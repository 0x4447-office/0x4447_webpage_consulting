opinion: "David is a master DevOps Solutions Architect â€“ one of the best on this platform. His understanding of the AWS ecosystem is just exemplary and the level of automation he helped me achieve in such a short amount of time is simply amazing. I will definitely return with more projects in future, and highly recommend David to anyone looking to add an accomplished solutions architect to your team."

<p>The CEO of Vocatales created an educational platform that aims to reimagine vocabulary to aid learning. The setup was already running in AWS as a NVP but since the site was gaining popularity the project needed an overhaul from the AWS infrastructure stand point. </p>

<p>The CEO of the company asked me if I could help updating the stack design to bring it up to AWS best practices, and set it up for auto deployment and scalability. </p>

<p>Since this is my area of expertise I started working on the project immediately by creating a new CloudFormation file that included CodePipeline and CodeBuild for auto deployment. I then worked on an ECS setup to deliver the containers of the project in a auto scaling fashion. </p>

<p>I also helped the CEO understand AWS better by answering all of his questions and mentoring him about all the AWS best practices.</p>
